          <h3>A Lightweight Web-based Product</h3>

          <h4>Coding the Website</h4>
          <p>Since our client already had established branding and visual design, I began by analyzing the HTML and CSS provided along with the current website’s assets. After reviewing the design of the website, I began to add functionality based on the user stories by using jQuery.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I began by tackling the first user story by creating a script to allow the user to view the album info. After, I looked to tackle the song list functionality. Last but not least, I looked to incorporate functionality to the bottom music player bar, which gave the user total control over their listening experience.</p>

        <div id="key-takeaways"><h5>Key Takeaways:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Reviewing existing code from clients is important to see what is already implemented and what your expectations are for contribution</li>
            <li>Analyzing user stories and delivering on expectations is important by passing specific acceptance criteria, especially when coding a solution</li>
            <li>Use of Git/Github is key in the implementation of each user story in the process for version control and rollback capability</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="conclusion-body">
          <p><span class="emphasized">Bloc Jams</span> is a project that helped me gain some valuable experience in programming using jQuery. As jQuery is a widely-accepted and popular JavaScript library, learning to utilize it will help make front-end development more efficient on other projects in the future.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This project was unique in having established branding, HTML, and CSS structure. Clients may have a well-established brand already in place, or have a website already structured where they are looking either to improve upon their current iteration, or add greater functionality via JavaScript.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In the end, my work once again brought us back to the importance of addressing the user’s experience, and making sure the product can function as intended. Through the use of jQuery, we were able to efficiently and effectively tackle their request.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In considering the future of <span class="emphasized">Bloc Jams</span>, I would focus on creating a mobile version of the web-based app. When accessing Bloc Jams on a mobile device, certain elements can be hard to access or control, especially the volume slider. With some small tweaks, this web-based app can find its way to mobile devices with ease.</p>
